### Minor Changes

- 39a17a9: An HTTP/1.1 Client Module for NestJS Applications.

  While working with Distributed Workloads, Horizontal Scaling and Microservices, we often have to make Remote Procedure Calls from one service to the other and these might well just be HTTP requests. To simplify making HTTP requests from a NestJS Application in a Web Backend, this module can be leveraged to build Type Safe modules.
